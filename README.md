# EDA-Diabetes-Dataset
This project analyzes a healthcare and diabetes dataset for binary classification, focusing on EDA to identify key factors like age, BMI, and glucose levels in predicting diabetes risk. Outliers suggest further investigation. The dataset is ideal for future machine learning model development based on EDA insights.
